# NetSpan_ACP
Docker Build for NetSpan (R) ACP Software

> My development on this project is published freely. <br>
However, the NetSpan Software in this repository belongs solely <br> 
to AirSpan (R) and their terms apply. <br>

## Instructions:
1. Install MySQL container per the convenience script.  
2. Compile and run Docker container for NetSpan.  

## Errors:
Repo is under heavy development and is currently a work in progress.
install_nms.sh is not included in this repo because it exceeds 100mb in size.  (lfs storage fixes this?  don't understand that...)
